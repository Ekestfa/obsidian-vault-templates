# Zettelkasten Vault Template for Obsidian
A pre-configured Obsidian vault template designed to help you implement and maintain the Zettelkasten note-taking methodology effectively. This template provides an organized folder structure to streamline your thinking, learning, and writing process.
## 🎯 Purpose
This vault is designed for the **Zettelkasten method** (aka "slip-box"). It's a powerful system for knowledge management that emphasizes creating interconnected, atomic notes to foster insight, creativity, and long-term retention of information. This template gives you the scaffolding to start building your personal knowledge base immediately.

## 📁 Folder Structure & Usage
The vault is organized into the following directories, each serving a specific purpose in the Zettelkasten workflow:

|Folder|Purpose|
|---|---|
|**`Canvases/`**|A directory for storing Canvas files. Use Canvases to create visual relationships and mind maps between your notes.|
|**`Excalidraw/`**|A dedicated space for Excalidraw drawing files. Ideal for sketching diagrams, flowcharts, and hand-drawn-style illustrations to complement your notes.|
|**`Fleeting Notes/`**|This is your inbox for quick, unpolished thoughts. Capture ideas, questions, and reminders here. The goal is to process these notes later into more permanent formats.|
|**`Kanbans/`**|A place for Kanban board files (created with the Kanban plugin). Use these to manage projects, track tasks, or visualize your note-processing workflow.|
|**`Literature Notes/`**|Contains notes summarizing information from external sources (books, articles, podcasts, etc.). These should be in your own words and include references to the original source.|
|**`Permanent Notes/`**|The core building blocks of your Zettelkasten. These are atomic, self-contained notes written in your own words, often synthesized from multiple literature notes or personal experiences. They are intended to be evergreen and form the main network of ideas.|
|**`Resources/`**|A storage space for media and document files (e.g., JPG, PDF, PNG, CSV) that are referenced in your notes. Keeping them here helps maintain a clean vault structure.|
|**`Templates/`**|Holds template files for creating consistent note structures. Use these to standardize the format of your fleeting, literature, and permanent notes.|

## 💡 Recommended Workflow
1. **Capture:** Jot down ideas in `Fleeting Notes/`.

3. **Connect:** As you create permanent notes, actively link them to existing notes. Ask yourself: "How does this idea relate to what I already know?"
4. **Use & Create:** Leverage your network of notes for writing projects, problem-solving, and generating new ideas.
